<p>Every day, the townlands from OpenStreetMap are processed and this website is updated. When this happens, we record how much of Ireland is covered by townlands, and from that predict how long it'll take to finish the whole lot</p>

<p>When you see "a hundred billion years", this means nothing was added in that time period. If nothing is being added, then you'll never finish!</p>
